# Python Programming Basics: Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental Python programming concepts, including regular expressions, arrays, linked lists, and other essential data structures. Each section includes explanations, examples, and practical exercises.

## Table of Contents

1. [Regular Expressions](#regular-expressions)
2. [Lists and Array Operations](#lists-and-array-operations)
3. [Matrix Operations](#matrix-operations)
4. [Linked Lists](#linked-lists)
5. [Queues and Stacks](#queues-and-stacks)

## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. This section includes examples such as phone number validation, postal code validation, and text replacement.

## Lists and Array Operations

This section covers basic array operations using Python lists, including accessing elements, traversing arrays, adding and removing elements, and searching. It also includes exercises for array manipulation.

## Matrix Operations

Learn how to perform matrix operations such as matrix addition using Python lists.

## Linked Lists

Understand the implementation and operations of linked lists, including insertion, traversal, and printing in reverse order.

## Queues and Stacks

Explore the concepts of queues and stacks using Python's `collections.deque` module. This section includes examples of queue operations (enqueue and dequeue) and stack operations (push and pop).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
