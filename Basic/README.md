# Python Programming Basics: Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental Python programming concepts, including regular expressions, arrays, linked lists, and other essential data structures. Each section includes explanations, examples, and practical exercises.

## Table of Contents

1. [Regular Expressions](#regular-expressions)
2. [Lists and Array Operations](#lists-and-array-operations)
3. [Matrix Operations](#matrix-operations)
4. [Linked Lists](#linked-lists)
5. [Queues and Stacks](#queues-and-stacks)
6. [Sorting Algorithms](#sorting-algorithms)

## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. This section includes examples such as phone number validation, postal code validation, and text replacement.

## Lists and Array Operations

This section covers basic array operations using Python lists, including accessing elements, traversing arrays, adding and removing elements, and searching. It also includes exercises for array manipulation.

## Matrix Operations

Learn how to perform matrix operations such as matrix addition using Python lists.

## Linked Lists

Understand the implementation and operations of linked lists, including insertion, traversal, and printing in reverse order.

## Queues and Stacks

Explore the concepts of queues and stacks using Python's `collections.deque` module. This section includes examples of queue operations (enqueue and dequeue) and stack operations (push and pop).

## Sorting Algorithms

This section introduces sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Quick Sort. It includes explanations of how these algorithms work and example implementations in Python.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that in practice is faster than Merge Sort and Heap Sort. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd /Users/xuxiaoyu/Desktop/Learning/Python
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook python-basics-notebook.ipynb
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `re` module (for regular expressions)
- `collections` module (for deque)
